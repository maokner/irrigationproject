This project is an automated way to keep plants healthy by monitoring soil moisture 
and watering only when needed. It uses a moisture sensor, a Raspberry Pi, and a water pump 
to deliver just the right amount of water. The system is easy to use, efficient, and helps 
save water while caring for your plants.
